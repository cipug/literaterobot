= About CIPUG =

Founded in March 2019, the Channel Islands Python User Group is a monthly meet up for users of the Python programming language.

We welcome users of all levels, from beginner to expert, into a safe, fun and social forum to share ideas & tools, ask and give advice, and generally improve and promote Python use across the islands.

For more information on upcoming meet ups check the [[jersey|meetups]] page or feel free to drop an email to rcwd@cipug.org.
