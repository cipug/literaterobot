= Channel Islands Python User Group Code of Conduct - Draft =

'''''This is a draft document subject to discussion and review at the next CIPUG, Jersey Meetup'''''

The Channel Islands Python User Group (CIPUG) community is made up of members from a range of different backgrounds with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community, we encourage you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep ours a positive, successful, and growing community.

A member of the CIPUG community is:

'''Open'''

Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on projects, demos, problems, or otherwise. We're receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

'''Considerate'''

Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Python users. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.

'''Respectful'''

Members of the community are respectful. We are respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We are respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate user group and the wider Python community. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.

Overall, we're good to each other. We contribute to this community not because we have to, but because we want to. If we remember that, these guidelines will come naturally.

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

 * Being kind to others
 * Behaving professionally
 * Using welcoming and inclusive language
 * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
 * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
 * Focusing on what is best for the community
 * Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

 * Harassment of conference participants in any form
 * Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
 * Violent threats or language directed against another person
 * Sexual language and imagery in any conference venue, including talks
 * Insults or put downs
 * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
 * Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
 * Unwelcome physical contact
 * Sustained disruption of events
 * Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional group including people of many different backgrounds

Members asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a member engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the CIPUG organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or temporary or permanent expulsion from the group.
