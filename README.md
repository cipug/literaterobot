# Literate Robot

A collaborative project from the CI Python User Group. Based on Wagtail CMS, Literate Robot is a working title for a lightweight, flexible publishing platform that can be used for singular or collective writing with (hopefully) the best qualities of a wiki and a modern CMS rolled into one.

## Get Involved

During the initial phase, involvement is limited to CIPUG members. You are, of course, welcome to fork the project. Once a baseline of functionality has been established, the project may be opened up to a wider audience of developers.

For those who qualify (aka members of CIPUG) please request access to the project by emailing opensource@cipug.org or by asking at the next meetup. Once enrolled, you will have access to the [Project](https://github.com/cipug/literate-robot/projects/1) which is used to track tasks in a simple (but very effective) Kanban board, as well as [Issues](https://github.com/cipug/literate-robot/issues) where we will track bugs (and features) as they arise. 

Further documentation can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki) (as and when it's been populated) and eventually on the project website itself which will, in a moment of exquisite meta, by running on the latest release of the code it concerns.

## Caveat Emptor

This isn't even beta software and is being written by developers with a range of levels of experience. It may contain bugs & security issues. It may cause computer issues across a wide range including security holes, performance issue and execution of opcodes, 0x9D and 0xDD (HCF). Finally, it may borrow your car without asking, sneak fifties out of your wallet and generally sit about the house making a nuisance of itself - you have been warned!
